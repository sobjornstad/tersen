* Title case conversion isn't really done:
  - Doesn't work if the word starts with punctuation
  - Only uppercases the first word
* Newline handling options for cmdline
* Improve warnings (print to stderr, give more details)

Maybe:

* Unicode normalization?
* Allow applying multiple annotations to one item (they would be cascaded through)
  (If someone really needed this, they could write a function that did it!)
