* Correct casing not identified on contractions?
  Sentence-starters are still getting lowercase.

Maybe:

* Unicode normalization?
* Allow applying multiple annotations to one item (they would be cascaded through)
  (If someone really needed this, they could write a function that did it!)
* Enable webtersen to work with arbitrary hooks and annotations.
  The fengari-web interop (https://github.com/fengari-lua/fengari-web) has a load() function
  that should be able to load arbitrary Lua source and return it as a function...although
  this appears to make it a JS function, which might require some messing around to call from Lua.
  Alternatively there's probably an eval() equivalent in Lua, so we could just grab the contents
  of the text box and eval() it from there.
* Make webtersen not lock up during long-processing;
  I can't make the Processing item show up because I don't know how
  to do async JS-style from within Lua. Maybe coroutines could fix this?
* Format webtersen webpage nicely.
